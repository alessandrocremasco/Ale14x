### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I introduce my self. I'm Alessandro Luca Cremasco, I'm 21 y/o, I live in Italy and currently I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Verona.

**My dream?** Develope my first app and become a developer. 

Currently I'm having fun writing scripts in Javascript, a language for which I always had an interest, while now, at the first year of university I'm writing code in C.

I hope to extend my knowledge in coding here on **GitHub** and knowing other developers that share my interests!

See you on *GitHub*! 

- *Skills in*: **C** & **JavaScript**
