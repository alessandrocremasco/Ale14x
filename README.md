### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I introduce my self. I'm Alessandro Luca Cremasco, I'm 20 y/o, I live in Italy and currently I'm studying Informatics at the University of Verona.

**My dream?** Develope my first app and become a developer. That's it, for now...  

When I began to code I start
Currently I'm having fun writing scripts in Javascript, a language for which I always had an interest. While at the first year of University I learned to code in C through the resolutions of problems, and now at the second year I have just started to code in Java.

I hope to extend my knowledge in coding here on **GitHub** and knowing other developers that share my interests!

See you on *GitHub*! 

- *Skills in*: **Javascript**, **HTML** & **C** + a little of **CSS**
- *Currently learning*: **Web-Dev Beginners Microsoft Course**
